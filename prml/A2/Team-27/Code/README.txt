After running 1d_data.py we will get the graphs of Erms Vs ln(lambda) and Erms Vs M graphs.
To get the graphs of polynomial fitting. Use the function plot_reg(a,b,c) where a denotes number of data samples, b denotes value of m , c denotes regularisation value.
On calling plot_reg(a,b,c) two graphs will be printed with testing data and training data polynomial fitting.


Run 2d_data.py same like 1d_data.py.Here on calling plot_reg(a,b,c) we will get scattering.


For Running linear_seperable data file name training data file as "trains.txt" and development data file as "devs.txt" and run the code.

For Running nonseperable data file name training data file as "trainns.txt" and development data file as "devns.txt" and run the code.

For Running real data file name training data file as "train.txt" and development data file as "dev.txt" and run the code.
